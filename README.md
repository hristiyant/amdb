# Problem
*Android Movie Database is your private movies library, where you can view and search amongst available titles, create, delete watchlists and edit them. After watching a particular movie, you will be able to put your own rating and then view a ranklist with all movies that you have watched. The app enables you to compare your individual ratings with your expectations, based on imdb rating and metascore.*
